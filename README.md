A quick data analysis tutorial that pulls data from IMDB to determine the best English language shows to watch

IMDB.com is a fantastic website giving us access to an infinite amount of info related to our favorite movies & TV shows.
In this project, I pulled their dataset for the top rated TV shows. This lengthy list includes many shows in different languages.
Using the power of pandas and data analysis, I sorted the list by English language shows, then further sorted these by the top 10 popular ones.
As an added bonus, I imported the plotly library to give our list of popular shows a nice visualization. 

Thanks for reading and I hope this project helps you discover your next favorite show to binge!
